# Frontend Mentor - Manage landing page

![Design of the Manage landing page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## H1!

Thanks for checking out first my front-end coding challenge.

**To do this challenge, I need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Use any tools I like to help me complete the challenge. So i've got something I'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

My users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See all testimonials in a horizontal slider
- Receive an error message when the newsletter sign up `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

Gimme your Congrats at https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/itmo-radio

**Thank You!**
